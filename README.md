##  Features

- **Dynamic Frontend:** A responsive and interactive user interface built with **React.js**.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Modular frontend structure with reusable components like `Navbar`, `Footer`, `Pricing`, etc., for maintainability.
- **RESTful Backend:** A powerful backend built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle all business logic and data processing.
- **Database Management:** Utilizes **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for defining clear data schemas (`name`, `qty`, `avg`, etc.) and models.
- **API Ready:** Currently uses dummy data for development but is architected to seamlessly integrate the **Zerodha API** for live data.
- **Error Handling:** Includes a custom `NotFound` page for a better user experience on invalid routes.
